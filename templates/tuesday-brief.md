## Tips From E74

- Lead with confidence ("AI isn't just accelerating cybersecurity—it IS cybersecurity")
- Use em-dashes for punch ("not as obstacles to bypass—but as systems to exploit")
- Name the threat specifically ("shadow agents", "prompt injection")
- End sections with tension ("These aren't hypothetical; they're happening")
